# Machine Learning

- This repo contains the work I did for [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
- This repo also contains a brief tutorial to Matlab, which should accompany my work for this course. 
- Note: Please refer to the .pdf file in each folder, which goes over the exercise and algorithm used.
