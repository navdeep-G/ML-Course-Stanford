# Machine Learning 

This repo contains materials about machine learning. This can range from implementations/analysis I have 
personally done to reference materials that I find extremely helpful (ranging from beginning to advanced).

Software used is as follows:
- Matlab/Octave
- R
- Python

*The above are split into folders.
